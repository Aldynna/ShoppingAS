<!--This FrameLayout will be the container view for a CrimeFragment.
    Notice that the container view is completely generic;
    it does not name the CrimeFragment class.
    You can and will use this same layout to host other fragments.
    Note that while activity_crime.xml consists solely of a container view for a single fragment,
    an activityâ€™s layout can be more complex and define multiple container views as well as widgets of its own.
